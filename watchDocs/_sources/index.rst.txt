Overview
===================

AllWatch (or UniversalWatch) is a project that aims to provide a unified way to make simple wearable applications for multiple devices. 
It is both lightweight and easy to implement, effectively making it a reasonable way to gain access to applications for wearables running on propertiary OSs that either do not offer SDK or have a very limited
base of dedicated applications. 

Implementation depends entirely on the device, yet following the guidelines in this documentation should be enaugh to run every app ever made for this platform.

The only requirement for the watch is to be able to parse JSON and have enough ram to store the data buffer. 30kb only for the buffer is the minimal recommended amount.
